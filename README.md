### Einstein Vision/Language üëì

_*Description*_:
The Einstein Vision/Language add-on allows you to leverage AI in your application by making image recognition and natural language processing (NLP) easily accessible. You can train deep learning models or use predefined models using a REST API, as long as an API access token is obtained. It is compatible with any programming language.

*_Use case:_*
Here, I use Einstein NLP‚Äôs community based sentiment to analyze the sentiment of the customer‚Äôs text message response without having to build my own model using this endpoint: https://metamind.readme.io/docs/use-pre-built-models-sentiment

This responds with positive/negative/neutral probabilities of the given input.

### Heroku Connect (First Party!) üîå

_*Description*_:
This add-on allows you to bi-directional sync between Salesforce and your Heroku application. Unify and/or share data in your Postgres database with the contacts, accounts and other custom objects in the Salesforce database.

*_Use case:_*
In this instance, Heroku Connect is used to write captured data from my typeform survey into a contact record within Salesforce, as well updating the corresponding record once the sentiment is analyzed from the text response.


### Heroku Postgres (first party!)

_*Description*_:
Our most popular add-on to date, Heroku Postgres provides a seamless approach of a managed data service in tandem to building your applications using PostgreSQL, one of the world‚Äôs most popular and powerful relational databases.

*_Use case:_*
Use Heroku Postgres to store and persist data records. Must be used for Heroku Connect to fully work. It creates a table in PG which syncs to Salesforce.

### Heroku Redis (First party!)

_*Description*_:
Heroku Redis is an in-memory key-value data store, run by Heroku, that is provisioned and managed as an add-on (https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis).

*_Use case:_*
Used to process and schedule background jobs like delegating to Till, and  in a queue system.

### PaperTrail

_*Description*_:
Papertrail (https://elements.heroku.com/addons/papertrail) is an add-on (https://elements.heroku.com/addons) providing hosted log aggregation and management, including real-time tail, search, and alerts on application and platform logs.

*_Use case:_*
Use papertrail to check and tail (follow) live logs from my application, and monitoring events that are received/sent to help debug issues.

### Till

_*Description*_:
The till add-on is a way to ask questions via SMS and receive validated responses via webhook, enabling instant alerts, flash surveys, and real-time two-way communication with a simple HTTP API.

*_Use case:_*
Once customer survey response is sent, use Till to deliver an SMS question to the given phone #. Then, we subscribe to the event (webhook) with the user‚Äôs SMS response.
